****************** HEURISTICS / OVERALL PROCESS **********************

5 passes (possibly on different screens)


Pass 1 - Preprocessing:
	- Bitrate checking
	
Pass 2 - All metadata minus genre/style:

	Main heuristic:
		- Search for MB ids and use those
		- My heuristic using artist/album data, number of tracks, track lengths, filenames etc.
		- Fingerprinting

	Give warnings about:
		- Incomplete albums
		- Garbage data

Pass 3 - Genre/style from foo_discogs:

Pass 4 - Album art finder:

Pass 5 - Postprocessing:
	- Copy/swap tags
	- Tags -> Filenames
	- Embedding album art etc.
	- Conformance to style
