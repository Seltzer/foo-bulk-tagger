****************** HEURISTICS / OVERALL PROCESS **********************

5 passes (possibly on different screens)


Pass 1 - Preprocessing:
	- Bitrate checking
	
Pass 2 - All metadata minus genre/style:

	Main heuristic:
		- Search for MB ids and use those
		- My heuristic using artist/album data, number of tracks, track lengths, filenames etc. Cases:
			- Artist + Album tags both present without multivalue property
				Search for releases by artist and album name
				
				- 1 result - take it
				- >1 result - apply sub-heuristic to choose correct one
				- 0 results
			- Artist + Album tags both present with multivalue
			- Artist present but not album - use #tracks heuristic on all releases of all artist results
			- Album present but not artist - use #tracks heuristic on all release results
			- No artist/album tags. Then:
				- Search by track data OR
				- Use filename/foldername
							

		- Fingerprinting

	Give warnings about:
		- Incomplete albums
		- Garbage data

Pass 3 - Genre/style from foo_discogs:

Pass 4 - Album art finder:

Pass 5 - Postprocessing:
	- Copy/swap tags
	- Tags -> Filenames
	- Embedding album art etc.
	- Conformance to style
