TODO



MatchWithReleases Stuff:

* Add popups for tracks which show their metadata
* Maybe it'd be a better idea to divide track selections according to the user's current Foobar
  division
* Releases to Match treeview:
	- Decide whether to allow non-leaf nodes to be clickable. If they're clickable they should
	  probably trigger changes in the track listbox too.
	- Decide whether we want to show the root node
* Matching heuristics:
	- Look into track fingerprinting
* Add some sort of control for displaying possibly editable metadata for a selected release:
  Ideally, we should emulate (read steal) Foobar's property window which has all of this stuff 
  implemented exactly as I want it. That's possibly what the inplace_edit headers in
  ATL helpers are for but I haven't really looked into to it - would be a lot easier if it was
  actually documented ffs. MFC's property grid control is roughly what I want.


Altering Releases Stuff:
* Tag mappings etc... haven't started.


Misc:
* Database of common searches
* Improve efficiency (i.e. in SelectionTreeView) by caching results of previous queries

Learning:

* ID3 stuff
