TODO



MatchWithReleases Stuff:

* Add popups for tracks which show their metadata
* Maybe it'd be a better idea to divide track selections according to the user's current Foobar
  division. If not, still have to add folder location
* Releases to Match treeview:
	- Decide whether to allow non-leaf nodes to be clickable. If they're clickable they should
	  probably trigger changes in the track listbox too.
	- Decide whether we want to show the root node
* Matching heuristics:
	- Look into track fingerprinting
* Property Grid for metadata
	- Erase when a new selection is made
	- Allow writing to tags



Altering Releases Stuff:
* Tag mappings etc... haven't started.


Misc:
* Database of common searches
* Improve efficiency (i.e. in SelectionTreeView) by caching results of previous queries

Learning:

* ID3 stuff
