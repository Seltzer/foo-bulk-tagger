TODO



MatchWithReleases Stuff:

* Add popups for tracks which show their metadata
* Releases to Match treeview:
	- Decide whether to allow non-leaf nodes to be clickable. If they're clickable they should
	  probably trigger changes in the track listbox too.
	- Decide whether we want to show the root node
	- Empty strings aren't handled properly
	- Refresh when we update tags
	- Refresh when anything updates tags
	- Maybe it'd be a better idea to divide track selections according to the user's current Foobar
		division. 

* Fingerprinting
	- Use Foobar SDK instead of LAME
	- In the meantime, figure out why LAME is choking on the Jesus Lizard
	- Clean up big time - get rid of example and makefiles, use static linking instead of dynamic
	- Figure out how to use PUIDs within MusicBrainZ API

* Matching heuristics:
	- Look into track fingerprinting
* Property Grid for metadata
	- Erase when a new selection is made
	- Detect duplicate tags
	- Fix weird UI semantics for release/track selection
	- Trim tags
	- Show standard tags, even if they don't exist
	- Make more like Foobar properties window... edits apply straight away without enter
	- Consider whether data might be stale
* Remove memory leaks
* Make more robust with regard to closing/reopening



Altering Releases Stuff:
* Tag mappings etc... haven't started.


Misc:
* Database of common searches
* Improve efficiency (i.e. in SelectionTreeView) by caching results of previous queries
* Store strings somewhere
* Fix 256 char buffers

Learning:

* ID3 stuff
