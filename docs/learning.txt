ATL Tutorial:

Curiously recurring template pattern
ATL Windows including message maps, declarations and traits
	Note that windows are not destroyed when CWindow goes out of scope
Event-handlers (BHANDLED and parameter unpacking)
Chaining in message maps to support mix-in classes
Implementation of ATL windows/dialogs (including dialog resource IDs)
	
	
WTL 1:


Header includes and #defines, different classes, 
DECLARE_FRAME_WND_CLASS which loads other resources based on an ID
CreateWindow/CreateWindowEx
Slightly different message maps to ATL - MSG_WM_CREATE instead of MESSAGE_HANDLER... still use COMMAND_ID_HANDLER_EX

Clock Example:

	- CIdleHandler (OnIdle())
	- CMessageFilter (PreTranslateMessage())
		CMessageLoop synopsis
	- CUpdateUI
