Changes for libmusicbrainz 2.1.2
-------------------------------------

   - Since expat is now installed on most systems we removed our internal copy
     and now rely on the system installed version.
   - Juergen Kreileder Supplied minimal patch for making sure that mb_client still works
     when CDO_CHECK_TYPE is defined
   - Fixed a C++ style variable declaration inside the album.c C module
   - On linux the cdrom drive is now opened in non-blocking mode
   - Fixed bug #834541: Tagger setting track no. is 0 - possibly due to trm mixup?
   - Added support for parsing AdvancedRelationship date. Also added new
     getrels.c example program.
   - Re-added the python bindings and changed the binding's version number to
     match the version of this lib.
   - Fixed bug # 1224562: libmusicbrainz fails to post large RDF. This fixes
     problems looking up CDs with large numbers of tracks. (This was also  
     bug # 725701 ignores blank tracks)

   The included perl bindings had the following changes:
      - Updated bindings to match up to 2.1.1
      - Fixed int size cast warning
      - Fixed #6431: unmatched bootstrap parameter
      - Updated req for MusicBrainz::Queries to 0.07

   The included python bindings had the following changes:
      - Fixed #957393: Python Bindings type bug
      - Fixed #1206514: Python bindings to select release not up-to-date

Changes for libmusicbrainz 2.1.1
-------------------------------------

   - Return special TRMs for special conditions for TRM generation:
     c457a4a8-b342-4ec9-8f13-b6bd26c0e400  -- Sigserver busy and overloaded
     f9809ab1-2b0f-4d78-8862-fb425ade8ab9  -- Source file is too short to calculate TRM
     7d154f52-b536-4fae-b58b-0666826c2bac  -- File is slience

   - If the TRM signature server becomes overloaded, it will now start
     returning HTTP 503 error codes and the TRM generator will catch that
     and return the Sigserver busy TRM shown above.


Changes for libmusicbrainz 2.1.0
-------------------------------------

   - moved the python bindings into a new seperate project
   - rewrote the mp3 duration detection code to be more robust
     by making it vastly easier. In the process the bitzi 
     related code has been tossed. This should make the libary
     smaller and the mp3 duration checking faster.
   - Due to the bitzi code being removed, the SHA1 and Bitprint
     related functions have been removed.
   - Added query items for Release Dates/Countries, Amazon Asins and Amazon cover art URLs
   - Move include files into include/musicbrainz so that the example
     files will compile outside of the libmusicbrainz client 
     source tree.

Changes for libmusicbrainz 2.0.2
-------------------------------------

   - Added support for Mac OS X
   - Improved build system
   - Added build files for Visual Studio .NET (VC7)

Changes for libmusicbrainz 2.0.1
-------------------------------------
   - Added patch for pkgconfig
   - Threading handled correctly in python wrapper
   - New perl bindings
   - Had client use HTTP 1.0 rather than HTTP 1.1
   

Changes for libmusicbrainz 2.0.0
-------------------------------------

   - Removed some spurious C++ comments from mb_c.h
   - Fixes and improvements to the python language bindings and tools
   - Updated NetBSD cdrom reading code

Changes for libmusicbrainz 2.0.0-pre4
-------------------------------------

   - Two new functions have been added:
       mb_GetFragmentFromURL - Retrieve a fragment from a URI
       mb_GetOrdinalFromList - Retrieve a list ordinal from a given list -- 
                               this is sometimes needed to determine the 
                               location of an item in a list. (e.g. a track in 
                               an album in order to find the track number)
   - The TRM code has been updated for TRM B#er.
   - New queries have been added to queries.h in order to support the improved
     FileLookupInterface.
   - The client library now uses the mm-2.1 and mq-1.1 namespaces.
   - The client library will now be referred to as libmusicbrainz

Changes from version 1.1.0 to version 2.0.0-pre1
------------------------------------------------

   - Added authentication support
   - Added new queries
   - Added support for submitting client version to the server 
     during TRM submits
   - Updated client code for TRM B#er

Changes from version 1.0.1 to version 1.1.0
-------------------------------------------

   - Fixed an OpenBSD 3.0 compile problem
   - Updated libtool version to 1.4.2 in hopes to get it to build on OSX.
   - Added MBQ_Quick queries to support the MB Tagger
   - Fixed a bug in the TRM generation that caused different TRMs to be
     generated for subsequent runs on the same file.

Changes from version 1.0.0 to version 1.0.1
-------------------------------------------

   - Fixed the multi drive support under windows.
   - Added support for setting the depth of a query via GET methods.
   - Added SetDebug() function that allows the caller to set the
     debug mode. In debug mode the library will print the server
     URL, query and responses to stdout.
   - Fixed a few crash bugs in the bitzi id3/mp3 metadata code
   - Changed the bitzi plugin manager to not load plugins, in order
     to avoid the unecessary dependency on dlopen/dlsym/dlclose.
   - Removed a bunch of generates files from the CVS archive.
